> Give a scenario where the deadlock-avoidance mechanism described above does
not work. (Hint: In the exchange problem, each process knows in advance which
accounts it will need to get access to. Consider a situation where a process
must get access to some shared resources before it can know which additional
shared resources it will require.)

I couldn't think of anything that requires uninterrupted locks botk on the
original resources and on the discovered ones. The most promising ideas seem
to be an interaction between two resources that results in a third one. The
problem is that one could sidestep the issue by renewing the locks in order
once the new resource is known.
