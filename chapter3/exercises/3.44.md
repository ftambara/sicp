> Consider the problem of transferring an amount from one account to another.
Ben Bitdiddle claims that this can be accomplished with the following
procedure, even if there are multiple people concurrently transferring money
among multiple accounts, using any account mechanism that serializes deposit
and withdrawal transactions, for example, the version of make-account in the
text above.

```racket
(define (transfer from-account to-account amount)
 ((from-account 'withdraw) amount)
 ((to-account 'deposit) amount))
```

> Louis Reasoner claims that there is a problem here, and that we need to use a
more sophisticated method, such as the one required for dealing with the
exchange problem. Is Louis right? If not, what is the essential diï¬€erence
between the transfer problem and the exchange problem? (You should assume that
the balance in from-account is at least amount.)

In this case the order of operations doesn't matter. As long as no account
holds a negative balance in any way, executing serialized withdrawals and
deposits in any order yield the same final states for all accounts involved.

The problem with the exchange procedure was that it began by accessing the
accounts' balances for calculating a difference, which could become obsolete
by the time the rest of the operations were run.

```racket
(define (exchange account1 account2)
 (let ((difference (- (account1 'balance)
                    (account2 'balance))))
  ((account1 'withdraw) difference)
  ((account2 'deposit) difference)))
```
