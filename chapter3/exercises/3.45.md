> Louis Reasoner thinks our bank-account system is unnecessarily complex and
error-prone now that deposits and withdrawals aren’t automatically serialized.
He suggests that make-account-and-serializer should have exported the
serializer (for use by such procedures as serialized-exchange) in addition to
(rather than instead of) using it to serialize accounts and deposits as
make-account did. He proposes to redeﬁne accounts as follows:

```racket
(define (make-account-and-serializer balance)
 (define (withdraw amount)
  (if (>= balance amount)
   (begin (set! balance (- balance amount)) balance)
   "Insufficient funds"))
 (define (deposit amount)
  (set! balance (+ balance amount)) balance)
 (let ((balance-serializer (make-serializer)))
  (define (dispatch m)
   (cond ((eq? m 'withdraw) (balance-serializer withdraw))
    ((eq? m 'deposit) (balance-serializer deposit))
    ((eq? m 'balance) balance)
    ((eq? m 'serializer) balance-serializer)
    (else (error "Unknown request: MAKE-ACCOUNT" m))))
  dispatch))
```

> Then deposits are handled as with the original make-account:
```racket
(define (deposit account amount)
((account 'deposit) amount))
```
> Explain what is wrong with Louis’s reasoning. In particular, consider what
happens when serialized-exchange is called.

```racket
(define (exchange account1 account2)
 (let ((difference (- (account1 'balance)
                    (account2 'balance))))
  ((account1 'withdraw) difference)
  ((account2 'deposit) difference)))

(define (serialized-exchange account1 account2)
 (let ((serializer1 (account1 'serializer))
       (serializer2 (account2 'serializer)))
  ((serializer1 (serializer2 exchange))
   account1
   account2)))
```

The problem is that procedures that use both the exposed serializer and the
internally serialized procedures cause deadlocks.

In this case, it occurs when this line is called:
```racket
  ((serializer1 (serializer2 exchange))
```
The `exchange` procedure is serialized and then called. When `difference` is
being calculated, the expression `(account1 'balance)` cannot proceed, since
another procedure which shares the same serializer (`exchange` itself) is
being awaited.
An inelegant solution would be to use a different serializer for internal
procedures:
```racket
(define (make-account-and-serializer balance)
 (define (withdraw amount)
  (if (>= balance amount)
   (begin (set! balance (- balance amount)) balance)
   "Insufficient funds"))
 (define (deposit amount)
  (set! balance (+ balance amount)) balance)
 (let ((internal-serializer (make-serializer))
       (external-serializer (make-serializer)))
  (define (dispatch m)
   (cond ((eq? m 'withdraw) (internal-serializer withdraw))
    ((eq? m 'deposit) (internal-serializer deposit))
    ((eq? m 'balance) balance)
    ((eq? m 'serializer) external-serializer)
    (else (error "Unknown request: MAKE-ACCOUNT" m))))
  dispatch))
```
