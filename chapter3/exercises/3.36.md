Suppose we evaluate the following sequence
of expressions in the global environment:

```racket
(define a (make-connector))
(define b (make-connector))
(set-value! a 10 'user)
```

At some time during evaluation of the set-value!, the fol-
lowing expression from the connectorâ€™s local procedure is
evaluated:
```racket
(for-each-except
    setter inform-about-value constraints)
```

Draw an environment diagram showing the environment
in which the above expression is evaluated.
