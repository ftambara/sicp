There are 3! = 6 cases:

## Option 1:
- Peter:    +$10 = $110
- Paul:     -$20 = $90
- Mary:     -$45 = $45

## Option 2:
- Peter:    +$10 = $110
- Mary:     -$55 = $55
- Paul:     -$20 = $35

## Option 3:
- Mary:     -$50 = $50
- Peter:    +$10 = $60
- Paul:     -$20 = $40

## Option 4:
- Mary:     -$50 = $50
- Paul:     -$20 = $30
- Peter:    +$10 = $40

## Option 5:
- Paul:     -$20 = $80
- Peter:    +$10 = $90
- Mary:     -$45 = $45

## Option 6:
- Paul:     -$20 = $80
- Mary:     -$40 = $40
- Peter:    +$10 = $50

There are two events for each transaction (a read and a write), which
totals 6 events. These events can be ordered in 90 ways, counting only
those cases where internal order is kept. The only new behavior we get
with interleaved transactions is having multiple versions of the state
of `balance`. For example:
