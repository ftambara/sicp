> Ben Bitdiddle suggests that itâ€™s a waste of time to create a new serialized
procedure in response to every withdraw and deposit message. He says that 
`makeaccount` could be changed so that the calls to protected are done outside
the dispatch procedure. That is, an account would return the same serialized
procedure (which was created at the same time as the account) each time it is
asked for a withdrawal procedure.

```racket
(define (make-account balance)
  (define (withdraw amount)
    (if (>= balance amount)
      (begin (set! balance (- balance amount))
             balance)
      "Insufficient funds"))
  (define (deposit amount)
    (set! balance (+ balance amount))
    balance)
  (let ((protected (make-serializer)))
    (let ((protected-withdraw (protected withdraw))
          (protected-deposit (protected deposit)))
      (define (dispatch m)
        (cond ((eq? m 'withdraw) protected-withdraw)
              ((eq? m 'deposit) protected-deposit)
              ((eq? m 'balance) balance)
              (else
                (error "Unknown request: MAKE-ACCOUNT"
                       m))))
      dispatch)))
```

concurrency is allowed by these two versions of make-account?

Without having seen the implementation yet, I suspect that serializer needs to
be applied each time a new concurrent user asks for a protected procedure.
This is coherent with the way the book puts it:

Multiple serializer calls may be needed to control the order of execution.
