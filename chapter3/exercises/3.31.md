The internal procedure `accept-action-procedure!` deﬁned in `make-wire`
speciﬁes that when a new action procedure is added to a wire, the procedure is
immediately run. Explain why this initialization is necessary.
In particular, trace through the `half-adder` example in the paragraphs above
and say how the system’s response would diﬀer if we had deﬁned
`accept-action-procedure!` as:
```racket
(define (accept-action-procedure! proc)
  (set! action-procedures
    (cons proc action-procedures)))
```

As a reminder, the `half-adder` definition was:
```racket
(define (half-adder a b s c)
  (let ((d (make-wire)) (e (make-wire)))
    (or-gate a b d)
    (and-gate a b c)
    (inverter c e)
    (and-gate d e s)
    'ok))
```

```racket
;; Delays
(define inverter-delay 2)
(define and-gate-delay 3)
(define or-gate-delay 5)

(half-adder input-1 input-2 sum carry)
;; action-procedures:
;;  - or-action-procedure input-1   (input-1 || input-2 -> d)
;;  - or-action-procedure input-2   (input-1 || input-2 -> d)
;;  - and-action-procedure input-1  (input-1 && input-2 -> carry)
;;  - and-action-procedure input-2  (input-1 && input-2 -> carry)
;;  - inverter carry                (!carry -> e)
;;  - and-action-procedure d        (d && e -> sum)
;;  - and-action-procedure e        (d && e -> sum)

(set-signal! input-1 1)
;; t=0
;; (call-each action-procedures) on input-1
;; add (input-1 || input-2 -> d) to the-agenda at t=3
;; add (input-1 && input-2 -> carry) to the-agenda at t=5

(propagate)
;; t=3 (input-1 || input-2 -> d) d 0 -> 1
;;  (call-each action-procedures) on d
;;  add (d && e -> sum) to the-agenda at t=6
;;
;; t=5 (input-1 && input-2 -> carry) carry stays 0
;;
;; t=6 (d && e -> sum) sum stays 0
;;
;; 'done

(set-signal! input-2 1)
;; t=6
;; (call-each action-procedures) on input-2
;; add (input-1 || input-2 -> d) to the-agenda at t=9
;; add (input-1 && input-2 -> carry) to the-agenda at t=11

(propagate)
;; t=9 (input-1 || input-2 -> d) d stays 1
;;
;; t=11 (input-1 && input-2 -> carry) carry 0 -> 1
;;  (call-each action-procedures) on carry
;;  add (!carry -> e) at t=13
;;
;; t=13 (!carry -> e) e 0 -> 1
;;  (call-each action-procedures) on e
;;  add (d && e -> sum) at t=16
;;
;; t=16 (d && e -> sum) sum 0 -> 1
;;  (call-each action-procedures) on sum
;;
;; 'done
```

By skipping the initial evaluation of added actions, the initial wire
conditions turn out wrong. For example, when propagating the setting of input-1
to a value of 1, the value of the internal wire e is 0 (when it should be 1) so
the value of sum after the propagation is incorrectly 0.
