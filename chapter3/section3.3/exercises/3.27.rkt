(memo-fib 6)

;; 1. Draw an environment diagram to analyze the computation of (memo-fib 3)
;; Assuming left-to-right evaluation order. Solution is in 3.27.png

;; 2. Explain why memo-fib computes the n-th Fibonacci number 
;;  in a number of steps proportional to n

;; After computing (memo-fib 2), all larger Fibonacci numbers require
;; only one new computation plus one table lookup. Thus, an increase
;; of one in the input results in two new computations, which is O(n).
;; That is if we ignore table lookup time, which may be O(n^2) in the book's
;; implementation.

;; 3. Would the scheme still work if we had simply deÔ¨Åned 
;;  memo-fib to be (memoize fib)?

;; No, because recursive calls to fib would not be memoized.
