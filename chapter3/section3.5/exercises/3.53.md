> Without running the program, describe the
elements of the stream deÔ¨Åned by

```racket
(define s (cons-stream 1 (add-streams s s)))
```

add-streams is defined as
```racket
(define (add-streams s1 s2) (stream-map + s1 s2))
```

The car of s is defined to be 1.
Its cdr is found by evaluating (stream-map + s s). The car of that
resulting stream is (+ (stream-car s) (stream-car s)) == 2
In the same way, the cddr of s is twice its cdr, 4, its fourth element is
twice its third, 8.
Stream s is therefore the series of powers of two starting from 2^0
(1 2 4 8 ...)
