> How many additions are performed when we compute the n-th Fibonacci number
using the deﬁnition of fibs based on the add-streams procedure?

```racket
(define fibs
 (cons-stream
  0
  (cons-stream 1 (add-streams (stream-cdr fibs) fibs))))
```

```
(stream-ref fibs 5)
0
1
+ 1 0 = 1
+ 1 1 = 2
+ 2 1 = 3
+ 3 2 = 5
```
On a zero-based index, we compute (max 0 (- n 1)) additions

> Show that the number of additions would be exponentially greater if we had
implemented (delay ⟨exp⟩) simply as (lambda () ⟨exp⟩), without using the
optimization provided by the memo-proc procedure described in Section 3.5.1.

If stream-map is implemented as
```racket
(define (stream-map proc stream)
  (if (stream-null? stream)
    the-empty-stream
    (stream-cons #:eager (proc (stream-car stream))
                 (stream-map proc (stream-cdr stream)))))
```
computing the n-th result of fibs would consist of:
```
stream-ref fibs 0 = 0
stream-ref fibs 1 = 1
+ (stream-ref fibs 1) (stream-ref fibs 0) = 1 addition
    > recomputed 0th and 1st, but those need no calculations
+ (stream-ref fibs 2) (stream-ref fibs 1) =
    + (+ (stream-ref fibs 1) (stream-ref fibs 0))
      1 = 1 + (1 + 0) additions
+ (stream-ref fibs 3) (stream-ref fibs 2) = 1 + (2 + 1) additions
+ (stream-ref fibs 4) (stream-ref fibs 3) = 1 + (4 + 2) additions
...
```

The number of additions follows the sequence:
0 0 1 2 4 7 12 20

Comparing that to the Fibonacci sequence:
1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21

Shows that the number of additions necessary for calculating the n-th Fibonacci
number, without cached results, is determined by F(n) - 1. Since the Fibonacci
sequence grows exponentially (the limit as n -> inf of F(n)/F(n-1) -> golden
ratio), the number of additions does too.
