1. (expand 1 7 10)
    (quotient (* 1 10) 7) = 1
2. (expand 3 7 10)
    (quotient (* 3 10) 7) = 4
3. (expand 2 7 10)
    (quotient (* 2 10) 7) = 2
4. (expand 6 7 10)
    (quotient (* 6 10) 7) = 8
5. (expand 4 7 10)
    (quotient (* 4 10) 7) = 5
6. (expand 5 7 10)
    (quotient (* 5 10) 7) = 7
7. (expand 1 7 10)

1. (expand 3 8 10)
    (quotient (* 3 10) 8) = 3
2. (expand 6 8 10)
    (quotient (* 6 10) 8) = 7
3. (expand 4 8 10)
    (quotient (* 4 10) 8) = 5
4. (expand 0 8 10)
    (quotient (* 0 10) 8) = 0
5. repeat step 4

Describes digits in 3/8 = 0.3750...

This stream gives a way to calculate all digits for expressing a rational
number in decimal form.
