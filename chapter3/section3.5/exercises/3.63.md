> Louis Reasoner asks why the sqrt-stream procedure was not written in the
following more straight-forward way, without the local variable guesses:
```racket
(define (sqrt-stream x)
 (cons-stream 1.0 (stream-map
                   (lambda (guess)
                    (sqrt-improve guess x))
                   (sqrt-stream x))))
```
> Alyssa P. Hacker replies that this version of the procedure is considerably
less efficient because it performs redundant computation. Explain Alyssa’s
answer.

That was exactly my question as well. For reference, the apparently more
efficient version is:
```racket
(define (sqrt-stream x)
 (define guesses
  (cons-stream
   1.0
   (stream-map (lambda (guess) (sqrt-improve guess x))
    guesses)))
 guesses)
```
The problem with Louis's an my proposal is that cached results are not reused,
since we reference a newly-build stream at each step.

```
sqrt-stream x:
1. 1.0
2. (sqrt-improve (stream-first (sqrt-stream x)) x)
                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                               new stream
    -> (sqrt-improve 1.0 x)
3. (sqrt-improve (stream-first (stream-rest this-stream)) x)
                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                                Since we referenced a new stream,
                                the second element is not cached here,
                                so a new stream-map will be invoked
                                to calculate the second element
4. In the same way, each stream-rest will fall back to getting the
    second element of a new stream. Therefore, each new step will
    create an additional stream, and generate an excess of operations
    proportional to the number of steps so far (because all new streams
    are referenced by each stream-map procedure)

This implementations generates results like this:
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
 /    /    /
1 -> 2 -> 3
 /    /
1 -> 2
 /
1

Instead, the original implementation generates results like this:
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
 /    /    /
1 -> 2 -> 3
```

In the original version we instead reference the same stream each time
the stream-map moves forward, so previous results are used and only
computed once.


> Would the two versions still differ in efficency if our implementation of
delay used only (lambda () ⟨exp⟩) without using the optimization provided by
memo-proc (Section 3.5.1)?

It would, since stream `guesses` would not remember already-calculated results,
so it would generate the same chain reaction as the innefficient
implementation.
