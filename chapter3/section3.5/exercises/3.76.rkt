;; Eva Lu Ator has a criticism of Louisâ€™s approach in Exercise 3.75. The
;; program he wrote is not modular, because it intermixes the operation of
;; smoothing with the zero-crossing extraction. For example, the extractor
;; should not have to be changed if Alyssa finds a better way to condition her
;; input signal. Help Louis by writing a procedure smooth that takes a stream
;; as input and produces a stream in which each element is the average of two
;; successive input stream elements. Then use smooth as a component to
;; implement the zero-crossing detector in a more modular style.
